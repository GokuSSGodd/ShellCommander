ShellCommander

ShellCommander is a streamlined command-line tool developed as a part of the educational initiative for understanding Unix-like system operations. This C++ application captures and elucidates the mechanics of command line argument processing, providing users, especially students and newcomers to systems programming, with a real-time look at how arguments are parsed and handled by shell environments.
Introduction

ShellCommander is a concise C++ application designed to teach the intricacies of command line interfaces and argument parsing in Unix-based systems. This tool is tailored for educational purposes, offering hands-on experience with command line operations, including argument parsing, file redirection, and glob patterns. It's an excellent resource for systems programming students or anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Unix shell operations.
Features

    Command Line Parsing: Demonstrates how command line arguments are parsed and processed in a Unix environment.

    Output Customization: Outputs the breakdown of command line arguments to a specified file in append mode, allowing for cumulative logging of command executions.

    Educational Tool: Provides a clear view of command line mechanics, aiding in educational efforts for those new to systems programming.

    Portable and Lightweight: Written in C++, making it easily portable across different Unix-like systems.

Usage

To utilize ShellCommander, compile the source code using a standard C++ compiler with C++11 support. Hereâ€™s a typical compile and run scenario:

g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -o ShellCommander ShellCommander.cpp
./ShellCommander -o example output.txt

Options:

    No specific command line options required for the basic functionality. All arguments are treated as part of the demonstration.

Example Command:

./ShellCommander "Hello, World!" -p -d /usr/local

This command will log the parsing of each argument, labeling them based on their characteristics as commands, switches, or general arguments.
Installation

ShellCommander requires a Unix-like environment to run. Installation involves compiling the source code:

g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -o ShellCommander ShellCommander.cpp

Ensure you have g++ or an equivalent C++ compiler installed in your system.
